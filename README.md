# Doodle_Project


This is our recreation of the tool Doodle, which helps you set appointments with a voting system. 

Our collaboration tool was a miro-board which can be found here: https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/Q2NqslUIvrwXvpnYlnCrYSVVWODszLiU4XyGueXSClXUETQUozPzfyBsbRQYTfCD .

A visual databasemodel can be found in the database folder, alongside the SQL-Statements.
